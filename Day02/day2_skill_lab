Day 2: Learning the Basics of Linux
What We Learned:

We spent today learning how to tell Linux what to do using simple commands. Linux is used a lot for servers and cloud stuff, so knowing these commands is super important for DevOps.

Simple Commands We Used:

Finding Our Way Around:

pwd: "Where am I right now?" (Shows the current folder)
ls: "What's in this folder?" (Lists files and folders)
ls -l: "Show me more details." (Lists files with extra info)
cd <folder>: "Go into this folder." (Changes to another folder)
cd ..: "Go back one folder."
mkdir <folder>: "Make a new folder."
rmdir <folder>: "Delete an empty folder."
touch <file>: "Make a new empty file."
rm <file>: "Delete a file."
rm -r <folder>: "Delete a folder and everything inside it." (Be careful!)
Looking at and Changing Files:

cat <file>: "Show me what's inside this file."
more <file> / less <file>: "Show me the file one page at a time."
nano <file>: "Let me edit this file." (Easy text editor)
vi <file>: "Let me edit this file." (More advanced editor)
Other Useful Things:

chmod: "Change who can use this file."
clear: "Clean the screen."
history: "Show me what commands I typed before."
man <command>: "Show me how to use this command." (Like a help manual)
whoami: "Who am I logged in as?"
uname -a: "Tell me about this computer."
What We Can Do Now:

We can now move around files and folders, look at files, and change them using simple commands. This is like learning the basic words to talk to a computer, which is really important for working with servers.
